Calculators
===========

For ASE, a calculator is a black box that can take atomic numbers and
atomic positions from an :class:`~ase.atoms.Atoms` object and calculate the
energy and forces and sometimes also stresses.

In order to calculate forces and energies, you need to attach a
calculator object to your atoms object:

>>> a = read('molecule.xyz')
>>> e = a.get_potential_energy()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/home/jjmo/ase/ase/atoms.py", line 399, in get_potential_energy
    raise RuntimeError('Atoms object has no calculator.')
RuntimeError: Atoms object has no calculator.
>>> from ase.calculators.abinit import Abinit
>>> calc = Abinit(...)
>>> a.set_calculator(calc)
>>> e = a.get_potential_energy()
>>> print e
-42.0

Here, we used the :meth:`~ase.atoms.Atoms.set_calculator` method to attach
an instance of the :mod:`ase.calculators.abinit` class and then
we asked for the energy.

Alternatively, a calculator can be attached like this::

  atoms = Atoms(..., calculator=Abinit(...))

or this::

  atoms.calc = Abinit(...)

Supported calculators
=====================

The calculators can be divided in three groups:

1) Asap_, GPAW_ and Hotbit_ have their own native ASE interfaces.

2) ABINIT, CASTEP, DFTB+, ELK, EXCITING, FHI-aims, FLEUR, GAUSSIAN,
   Gromacs, Jacapo, LAMMPS, MOPAC, NWChem, SIESTA, TURBOMOLE and VASP,
   have Python wrappers in the ASE package, but the actual
   FORTRAN/C/C++ codes are not part of ASE.

3) Pure python implementations included in the ASE package: EMT, EAM,
   Lennard-Jones and Morse.

=================================  ===========================================

The calculators included in ASE are used like this:

>>> from ase.calculators.abc import ABC
>>> calc = ABC(...)

where ``abc`` is the module name and ``ABC`` is the class name.

Calculator keywords
===================

Example for a hypothetical ABC calculator:

.. class:: ABC(restart=None, ignore_bad_restart_file=False, label=None,
               atoms=None, parameters=None, command='abc > PREFIX.abc',
               xc=None, kpts=[1, 1, 1], smearing=None,
               charge=0.0, nbands=None, **kwargs)

   Create ABC calculator

   restart: str
       Prefix for restart file.  May contain a directory.  Default
       is None: don't restart.
   ignore_bad_restart_file: bool
       Ignore broken or missing restart file.  By default, it is an
       error if the restart file is missing or broken.
   label: str
       Name used for all files.  May contain a directory.
   atoms: Atoms object
       Optional Atoms object to which the calculator will be
       attached.  When restarting, atoms will get its positions and
       unit-cell updated from file.
   command: str
       Command used to start calculation.  This will override any value
       in an :envvar:`ASE_ABC_COMMAND` environment variable.
   parameters: str
       Read parameters from file.
   xc: str
       XC-functional (``'LDA'``, ``'PBE'``, ...).
   kpts:
       Brillouin zone sampling:

       * ``(1,1,1)``: Gamma-point
       * ``(n1,n2,n3)``: Monkhorst-Pack grid
       * ``(n1,n2,n3,'gamma')``: Shifted Monkhorst-Pack grid that includes
         `\Gamma`
       * ``[(k11,k12,k13),(k21,k22,k23),...]``: Explicit list in units of the
         reciprocal lattice vectors
       * ``kpts=3.5``: `\vec k`-point density as in 3.5 `\vec k`-points per
         Ã…\ `^{-1}`.
   smearing: tuple
       The smearing of occupation numbers.  Must be a tuple:

       * ``('Fermi-Dirac', width)``
       * ``('Gaussian', width)``
       * ``('Methfessel-Paxton', width, n)``, where `n` is the order
         (`n=0` is the same as ``'Gaussian'``)

       Lower-case names are also allowed.  The ``width`` parameter is
       given in eV units.
   charge: float
      Charge of the system in units of `|e|` (``charge=1`` means one
      electron has been removed).  Default is ``charge=0``.
   nbands: int
      Number of bands.  Each band can be occupied by two electrons.

Not all of the above arguments make sense for all of ASE's
calculators.  As an example, Gromacs will not accept DFT related
keywords such as ``xc`` and ``smearing``.  In addition to the keywords
mentioned above, each calculator may have native keywords that are
specific to only that calculator.

Keyword arguments can also be set or changed at a later stage using
the :meth:`set` method:

.. method:: set(key1=value1, key2=value2, ...)

Calculator interface
====================

All calculators must have the following interface:

.. autoclass:: ase.calculators.interface.Calculator
   :members:


Electronic structure calculators
================================

These calculators have wave functions, electron densities, eigenvalues
and many other quantities.  Therefore, it makes sense to have a set of
standard methods for accessing those quantities:

.. autoclass:: ase.calculators.interface.DFTCalculator
   :members:
