Introduction
============

FHI-aims_ is a all-electron full-potential density functional theory
code using a numeric local orbital basis set. This interface provides
all that should be required to run FHI-aims_ from within ASE.

Running the Calculator
======================

The default initialization command for the FHI-aims calculator is

.. class:: Aims(output_template = 'aims', track_output = False)

In order to run a calculation, you have to ensure that at least the
following ``str`` variables are specified, either in the initialization
or as shell variables:

===============  ====================================================
keyword          description
===============  ====================================================
``run_command``   The full command required to run FHI-aims from
                  a shell, including anything to do with an MPI
                  wrapper script and the number of tasks.
                  An alternative way to set this command is via the
                  shell variable ``AIMS_COMMAND``, which is checked
                  upon initialization and when starting a run.
``species_dir``   Directory where the species defaults are located
                  that should be used. Can also be specified with
                  the system variable ``AIMS_SPECIES_DIR``.
``xc``            The minimal physical specification: what kind of
                  calculation should be done.
===============  ====================================================

In addition, you might want to specify at least one of self-consistency
accuracy commands (see below) in order to avoid an excessively long
calculation.

Two general options might come in useful to post process the output:

===================  ====================================================
keyword              description
===================  ====================================================
``output_template``  Base name for the output, in case the calculator
                     is called multiple times within a single script.
``track_output``     ``True/False`` - if ``True`` all the output files
                     will be kept, while the number of calls to the
                     calculator is encoded in the output file name.
===================  ====================================================

List of keywords
================

This is a non-exclusive list of keywords for the ``control.in`` file
that can be addresses from within ASE. The meaning for these keywords is
exactly the same as in FHI-aims, please refer to its manual for help on
their use.

One thing that should be mentioned is that keywords with more than
one option have been implemented as lists, eg.
``k_grid=(12,12,12)`` or ``relativistic=('atomic_zora','scalar')``.
In those cases, specifying a single string containing all the options is also possible.

None of the keywords have any default within ASE,but do check the defaults
set by FHI-aims. If there is a keyword that you would
like to set and that is not yet implemented here, it is trivial to add
to the first few lines of the aims calculator in the file
ASE/ase/calculators/aims.py .

   >>> calc.set( keyword=value )

Volumetric Data Output
======================

The class

.. class:: AimsCube(origin=(0,0,0),edges=[(0.1,0.0,0.0),(0.0,0.1,0.0),(0.0,0.0,0.1)],points=(50,50,50),plots=None)
